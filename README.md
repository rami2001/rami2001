Hello, my name is Rami ! Nice to meet you.
I’m interested in software engineering and fullstack developping
I’m currently learning web developping and try to be a little better at C++
I don't think i'm ready to collaborate on something yet ! But i'd love to collaborate on code optimizing and low-level languages coding in general.
I would hate to work on mobile apps.
You can send me a mail at miner_rami@hotmail.fr.
